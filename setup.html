For example, you may see shapes and be asked how round they appear or view a graph with a legend and interpret information about the data in the graph. You will be asked to respond by making button presses on a keyboard/mouse. You may be asked to complete questionnaires about your expertise or educational level in a given domain (e.g., neuroscience) and questionnaires about what sorts of things you like/dislike.
